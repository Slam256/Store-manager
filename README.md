**Link to project:**

**Tech used:** Node js and Express Js and a dash of HTML, Travis for CI

The main tech that i used here was express js. I used this because it is a Fast, un-opinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js It has a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy. I also used postman to test if the API would return the data that I want.
